# 📰 Hybrid Fake News Classifier

A Hybrid Fake News Detection system that combines **traditional machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to classify news articles as **real or fake**.

The project uses **TF-IDF with Gradient Boosting** to capture statistical text features and **BiLSTM with Attention** to learn contextual and sequential patterns. Predictions from both models are combined using **Logistic Regression (stacking)** for improved accuracy and robustness.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- TF-IDF + Gradient Boosting classifier
- BiLSTM with Attention mechanism
- Ensemble learning using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
